##Bangladesh Police Services
A crime Report and missing person finder Apllication




Motivation 
=============
Bangladesh has been  facing  the  problems  of  crime,  criminality  and  corruption with its diversified forms, from the very beginning of the country's independence.This project is aimed at developing an android app that can be used to eliminate some drawbacks in the current system of lodging a police complaint. People are avoiding crimes happening around them unless they are facing the same problem. On top of it due to technological advancements we are facing a massive amount of cyber crimes. If we ask them why aren’t you complaining to the police station? The answers are mostly the same: lack of justice, lack of interest to solve a case by police, bribe, they would be harassed instead of getting justice, courage to talk to police face to face also keep the incidents secret and many more. To solve these problems We here propose an android app to tackle these problems, 
so that people don't need to go to the police station physically. We will introduce a police rating system, this system will help police officers to grow interest in solving cases and more transparently,we will also make every conversation between police and complainants recorded and bring under higher supervision. This way we will be able to mitigate the fear to talk to police and bribery. We will introduce statistics of recent incidents near them which got justice in order to give them the confidence that they will get justice.  Since every single process will be done online, there won’t be any hassle or time consuming issues in it. 


Scope and Objectives
=============

Scope

According to a recent survey conducted by Cyber Crime Awareness Foundation, 80 percent of cyber crime victims do not report the cases to law enforcement agencies [the daily star,2019]. and  almost 73 percent of people are not satisfied after complaining to the police  because they are not successfully being reported or investigated and many more reasons [bangladesh post, 2020].
The scope of the system will include bringing more and more transparency in the law and order process by getting the entire system online so that the people using the system have a managed proof of the complaints raised.
The user will be able to provide feedback along with a rating against the investigation officer who will conduct his/her case, And the ratings will be visible to everyone thus this will greatly reduce the distaste toward solving police cases from the side of police.  
A user will be able ask his queries and the officer will answer them.even though the queries will be viewed only by the investigation officer and the complainer it will be automatically saved in online database 
And All the information about the missing or found person will be stored in the MySQL database and these includes the name, location, age, gender, relationship type, case status and two photos for a missing person and name, location, age, gender, life status, case status and two photos for a found person. One major issue needs to be included that, all the missing and found person  names and details will need to be merged manually by the admin panel but, we will introduce AI to merge them in future updates.
